## Introduction

As part of my continuous learning journey in cybersecurity, I've been actively working through the TRYCYBER platform. This repository contains the projects and solutions for each challenge I've encountered. I aim to strengthen my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity and network operations while documenting my growth along the way. 

## Challenges Completed

### Network Operations

**Challenge Overview**: The Network Operations challenge focuses on understanding network management, including tasks such as troubleshooting network issues, configuring network devices, and understanding core network protocols.

#### Steps Taken:
1. **Initial Setup**: Set up the network environment and began with basic network configurations.
2. **Troubleshooting**: Encountered several issues such as connectivity drops and incorrect configurations. Troubleshot using tools like ping, traceroute, and Wireshark.
3. **Solution Implementation**: Applied best practices for routing, IP addressing, and network security. Configured network devices to ensure smooth communication and optimized performance.

**Key Learnings**:
- Gained hands-on experience with networking tools and protocols.
- Learned how to diagnose and resolve network connectivity issues.
- Improved skills in configuring routers and switches.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Wireshark**: For network traffic analysis and troubleshooting.
- **Ping**: For basic network connectivity checks.
- **Traceroute**: Used to track the path of network packets.
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For simulating network configurations and devices.

## Future Goals

I plan to continue my journey with TRYCYBER and explore more advanced challenges related to cybersecurity, including penetration testing, threat analysis, and incident response. My ultimate goal is to pursue a career as a Cybersecurity Analyst, and these challenges are helping me build the foundation for that career.
