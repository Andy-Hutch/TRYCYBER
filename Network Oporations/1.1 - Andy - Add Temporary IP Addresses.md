# Adding Temporary IP Addresses to Server's Network Interface

## Overview

This guide walks you through the process of adding two temporary IP addresses to the `ens3` network interface on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. The IP addresses are added for short-term tasks, such as A/B testing, and will be removed after a reboot. These steps will help integrate the server into the network as requested by the development team.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 server
- Network interface `ens3`
- Administrative privileges (sudo access)

## Steps

### 1. Verify Current IP Addresses

To begin, check the current IP addresses assigned to the `ens3` network interface. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
ip -4 -br address show
```

This will output the IP addresses currently assigned to the interface. You should see an output like this:

```
ens3      UP 192.168.100.200/24
```

This shows that the `ens3` interface currently has one IP address (`192.168.100.200/24`).

### 2. Add the First Temporary IP Address

To add the first temporary IP address (`192.168.100.210/24`), run the following command:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.210/24 dev ens3
```

This command will add the IP address to the `ens3` interface. No output will be returned after running this command, but the IP address will be added.

### 3. Verify the Addition of the First IP Address

To confirm that the first IP address was successfully added, re-run the command:

```bash
ip -4 -br address show
```

The output should now include the new IP address, similar to the following:

```
ens3      UP 192.168.100.200/24 192.168.100.210/24
```

### 4. Add the Second Temporary IP Address

Now, add the second temporary IP address (`192.168.100.220/24`) using the following command:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.220/24 dev ens3
```

This command will add the second IP address to the `ens3` interface.

### 5. Verify the Addition of Both Temporary IP Addresses

To verify that both IP addresses have been successfully added, re-run the command:

```bash
ip -4 -br address show
```

You should now see output similar to this:

```
ens3      UP 192.168.100.200/24 192.168.100.210/24 192.168.100.220/24
```

### 6. Reboot Considerations

Keep in mind that the IP addresses added with the `ip addr add` command are temporary and will be removed after a reboot. If you need to make these IP addresses permanent, you can add them through the `netplan` configuration file.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we successfully added two temporary IP addresses to the `ens3` network interface of an Ubuntu 22.04 server for A/B testing. These IP addresses will be removed upon reboot. This method allows for easy temporary network configuration changes without permanently altering system files.

## Additional Notes

- The `ip addr add` command is used to add temporary IP addresses to a network interface in Linux.
- If permanent changes are required, consider using netplan or modifying the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.
