# Adding Temporary IP Addresses to Server's Network Interface

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for adding two temporary IP addresses to the `ens3` network interface of an Ubuntu 22.04 server. These IP addresses are added for short-term tasks, such as A/B testing, and will be removed after a reboot.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 server
- Network interface `ens3`
- Administrative privileges (sudo access)

## Steps

### 1. Verify Current IP Addresses

To start, review the current IP addresses assigned to the `ens3` network interface. Run the following command:

```bash
ip -4 -br address show
```

You should see output similar to this:

```
ens3      UP 192.168.100.200/24
```

This indicates that the `ens3` interface currently has one IP address (`192.168.100.200/24`).

### 2. Add the First Temporary IP Address

Next, add the first temporary IP address (`192.168.100.210/24`) to the `ens3` interface by running:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.210/24 dev ens3
```

No output will be returned, but the IP address will be successfully added.

### 3. Verify the Addition of the First IP Address

To verify that the first IP address was added successfully, run:

```bash
ip -4 -br address show
```

Expected output:

```
ens3      UP 192.168.100.200/24 192.168.100.210/24
```

### 4. Add the Second Temporary IP Address

Now, add the second temporary IP address (`192.168.100.220/24`) using the following command:

```bash
sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.220/24 dev ens3
```

No output will be shown, but the second IP address will be successfully added.

### 5. Verify the Addition of Both Temporary IP Addresses

To verify that both temporary IP addresses were added successfully, run:

```bash
ip -4 -br address show
```

Expected output:

```
ens3      UP 192.168.100.200/24 192.168.100.210/24 192.168.100.220/24
```

### 6. Reboot Considerations

Keep in mind that the IP addresses added using the `ip addr add` command are temporary and will be removed upon server reboot. If permanent configuration is needed, you can add the IP addresses through the netplan configuration file.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we added two temporary IP addresses to the `ens3` network interface of an Ubuntu 22.04 server for A/B testing. These IP addresses will be removed upon reboot. This method allows for easy temporary network configuration changes without permanent alteration to the systemâ€™s configuration files.
